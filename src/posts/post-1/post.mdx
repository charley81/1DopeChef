# BLT Salad

I call this recipe the BLT Salad and the reason being is it's like a BLT sandwich (_I'm assuming everyone knows what a BTL sandwich is_) except it doesn't have bread bread but has some addtional ingreients like cucmber and cheese.

Who am I kidding, it's just a salad but hear me out. For you keto friendly people like myself this is a great and easy meal that just doesn't have very many carbs at all and it's delicious.

You've probably got some left over salad in the fridge, if not whip up a nice little salad. Don't go overboard on the salad although it has it's place (large, veggie filled salads) most of the time some simple lettecue tomatoe and cucumber will do the trick.

Start out by chopping up lets say about a half a head of lettuce (feeds comfortable apox. 2 people) into small chunks. Once that's done wash it as best as possible and let rinse. I usually just turn the sprayer nozzle on at the kitchen sink and spray it as I move the lettuce around with my hands. Next peel the cumber and cut into small chunks. Next was one tomatoe and cut into small chunks.

Next is one of the best parts, cook a pack of bacon. Place the cooked bacon on a plate with a paper towel on top and bottom of bacon to soak up any greese, no need to overdo the fat here.

Once that's done combine the lettuce, tomatoe, cucmber, and crumbled bacon. Add some fresh high quality shredded cheese. I usualy like to add a small amount of dried jalepeno chips on top and salt and peper to liking.
